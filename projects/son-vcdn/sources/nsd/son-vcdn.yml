#
# This is the NSD of SONATA's vCDN pilot (version including vTU)
#
# @author SONATA
# date:2.11.2017
# Notes: This NSD does not depend on the type of the VNFs (i.e. L2/L3) thus it constructs the paths 
# being type unaware. 
# Chain 1(user): user->cpinput->vTC_in->vTC_out->vCC_in->vCC_in->cpoutput->server
# Chain 1(server): server->cpinput->vCC_in (L3)->vCC_in -> cpoutput -> user
# Chain 2(user): user->cpinput->vTC_in->vTC_out->vTU_in (--> the file is created on the server on the mounted disk - NFS outside of the graph)
# Chain 2 (server) the same with Chain #1(server) 
# NOTE: vTC -> vCC and vTC -> vTU are L3, the decision and steering is performed at the vTC. In this view the actual vTC2vCC and vTC2vTU virtual links
# do not need to appear in the forwarding paths 
# this makes the chains simpler (testing will be required) 
# Chain 1(user) user->cpinput->vTC_in->vTC_out->cpoutput (to server or to vTU)
# Chain 2(server) server->cpinput->vTC_in->vTC_out->cpoutput 
# from the above it can be deducted that it can be a single chain that can be fixed for the whole service !

#NOTE from the ETSI document: When no Network Forwarding Paths element is 
#included in a VNF Forwarding Graph descriptor, the forwarding path applicable to a traffic flow is decided at runtime (e.g. routeing of signalling messages 
#across call servers).
